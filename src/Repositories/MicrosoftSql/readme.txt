MicrosoftSql Repository Information
===================================

This repository relies on having the PDO drivers for MSSQL installed. You can fetch these from:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=20098

The download page seems to change as they update the version number, so if that URL has been retired try searching
the Microsoft download centre for "PHP PDO"

For my XAMPP installation I used the php_pdo_sqlsrv_54_ts.dll version.
